            <p>The Young Lewisham Project is an alternative provision based in Forest Hill in the borough of Lewisham, South East London. We offer a range of supportive, alternative, vocational programmes to young people who are perhaps not reaching their full potential in mainstream education in order to help maximise their chances of becoming valued members of our ever-evolving society.</p>

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
            In 1974 a group of Lewisham residents were frustrated by the fact that a few of the young people in their neighbourhood were becoming involved in anti-social behaviour and getting into trouble with the police; stealing motorbikes was a big problem. 
            
            The residents knew that this behaviour was largely due to local young people having nothing constructive to do in their spare time.
            
            One of the local residents came across a project in Birmingham that had set up a workshop for young people so that, instead of stealing motorbikes, they would learn to maintain, service and rebuild them. Inspired by this, they turned an old confectionary factory into a small workshop and encouraged local young people to come along and learn the basics of mechanics and  Young Lewisham Project was born</p>
