            The Young Lewisham Project is a registered charity that receives no statutory government funding, we rely heavily on grant and foundation funding to subsidise our projects and activities to make them accessible for all.   We are constantly looking for ways to raise funds to ensure the magnificent work we do and the help we give to young people can continue.</p>
            <br \>
            <p>You can support us in a number of ways - make a donation, volunteer your time, or even give us your old furniture, bikes or unwanted wood.</p>
