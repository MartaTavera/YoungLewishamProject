                The Young Lewisham Project is an alternative provision based in Forest Hill in the borough of Lewisham, South East London.
                
                We offer a range of supportive, alternative, vocational programmes to young people who are perhaps not reaching their full potential in mainstream education in order to help maximise their chances of becoming valued members of our ever-evolving society.</p>
